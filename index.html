        <p>
          The ethical principles of human rights describe the societal function
          of rights we share simply by virtue of being a human. The concept has
          been explored since the Middle Ages as an idea of natural rights
          existing through a theological lens, to the more secularized
          understanding arising in the 18th century wherein human rights are
          formed through human reason. Over time and with the evolution and
          integration of societies, what these rights are remains dynamic; they
          exist as a response to the conditions that people live in. With new
          technologies, rights that once helped to define a society’s structure
          may no longer be pertinent or complete in ensuring humanity can thrive
          within its current context. With the advent of the internet, and all
          the consequences - both positive and negative - that arise therein,
          these universal rights must be adapted to account for such ubiquitous
          change. <br /><br />
          It is not enough for the technology to merely exist when control lies
          within centralized-autocratic state and corporate powers. The
          existence of such technology must be moderated to serve humanity as a
          whole. Agents acting as public benefactors must advocate for:<br />

            Increased accessibility to the internet for regions and individuals
            outside of the scope of the internet.
          </li>
          <li>
            Progression in establishing the internet’s infrastructure as a
            universal public utility.

          <li>Equal treatment of traffic across the internet.</li>
          <li>
            Transparency in the collection and use of user generated data and
            its metadata.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h2 id="goals">Goals</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Access to the internet represents access to information, education,
            and increased economic liberation within market economies. The
            benefits for individuals to become connected have grown so vast that
            those without access will be unable to compete with those with
            access. While the general structure of society remains competitive
            rather than collaborative, universal access to this utility is
            necessary in providing at least some degree of economic equity.
          </li>
          <li>
            Municipalities must take on the responsibility of creating internet
            infrastructures that reach all those within their community.
            Individuals that live outside of a municipality should have internet
            access provided by the smallest governing body they reside within. A
            federated internet infrastructure ultimately provides the most
            control for individuals.
          </li>
          <li>
            In the instance that a region’s internet is served through private
            corporations, efforts must be made to prevent monopolization. Driven
            by profit, these companies have no reason to improve network
            accessibility, expanse, or efficiency when there is no competition
            within the market for users to choose.
          </li>
          <li>
            Any governing body that manages internet infrastructure must allow
            equal flow of traffic between entities. Distributing access
            asymmetrically artificially guides internet traffic to points that
            are curated by the governing body.
          </li>
          <li>
            Data generated by users when operating internet-based applications
            should be owned by those users. All forms of collection,
            interpretation, and dissemination of this data should be clearly
            stated to users who give those rights of data ownership over to the
            entities managing such applications. What data is being collected,
            how it is being used, and who/what has access to this data must be
            clearly presented to the user directly through the application.
          </li>
        </ol>
        <h2 id="closing">Closing Statement</h2>
        <p>
          The internet is a special technology in that it provides power to
          individuals while also connecting those individuals together. As a
          pure tool, it creates opportunity to connect to places previously
          inaccessible, collaborate with people on a global scale, and create
          new technologies what were otherwise impossible. Ensuring that the
          components of this tool remain under the ward of the people is
          essential in the development of a global, collaborative society.
          Dissolving centralized control of the internet into the smallest
          possible pieces is necessary in making the most of this technology,
          and solidifying the rights of every individual to access information
          across the globe.
